# Rubiks Cube

As the name of the Repository suggests, it is all about the Rubik's Cube. This includes visualisation/rendering of it as well as solving it.

Since the main goal of this project wasn't to get a great render engine, but more to learn the concepts of rendering and also to use it to have some form of visualization when solving the Rubick's Cube, I decided to not try and further improve the quality and FPS for rendering.
