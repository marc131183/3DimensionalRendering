# Rubicks Cube

As the name of the Repository suggests, it is all about the Rubicks Cube. This includes visualisation/rendering of it and also solving it.

## Content

- Function that can render 3D objects on a 2D surface
- Controls to change view of the object
- (soon) Algorithms to solve the Rubick's Cube

## TODO

- fix rendering when view vector is [0, 0, z]
- improve function to detect visibility of faces (needs to be faster/correct)
- parallelize rendering functions (maybe try use gpu for it?)
